  <h1>ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      JavaScript is a
      <mark><em>synchronous, blocking, single threaded</em></mark> language.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Synchronous:</strong> If we have two functions which log messages
      to the console, code executes top down, with only one line executing at
      any given time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Blocking</strong>:
      <ol>
        <li>
          No matter how long a previous process takes, the subsequent processes
          won't kick off until the former is completed.
        </li>
        <li>
          If function A had to execute an intensive chunk of code, JavaScript
          has to finish that without moving on to function B. Even if that code
          takes 10 seconds or 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Web app runs in a browser and it executes an intensive chunk of code
          without returning control to the browser, the browser can appear to be
          frozen.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Single-threaded</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A thread is simply a process that your JavaScript program can use to
          run a task.
        </li>
        <li>Each thread can only do one task at a time.</li>
        <li>
          JavaScript has just the one thread called the main thread for
          executing any code.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Problem with synchronous, blocking, single-threaded model of JavaScript.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li style="background-color:lightgray">
          <pre><code>
  let response = fetchDataFromDB('endpoint')</br>
  displayDataFromDB(response);</code>               
          </pre></li>
        <li><em>fetchDataFromDB('endpoint') could take 1 second or even more</em></li>
        <li>During that time, we can't run any further code.</li>
        <li>JavaScript, if it simply proceeds to the next line without waiting, we have an error because data is not what we expect it to be.</li>
      </ol>      
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How to achieve Async JavaScript?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>JavaScript is not enough.</li>
        <li>We need new pieces which are outside of JavaScript to help us write asynchronous code which is where web browsers come into play.</li>
        <li>Web browsers define functions and APIs that allow us to register functions that should not be exceeded synchronously, and should instead be invoked asynchronously when some kind of event occurs.</li>
        <li>For exmaple: that could be the passage of time ( setTimeout or setInterval), the user's interaction with the mouse (addEventListener), or the arrival of data over the network (callbacks, Promises, async-await).</li>
        <li>You can let your code do several things at the same time without stopping or blocking your main thread.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Timeouts & Intervals</h3>    
    <p>The JavaScript has traditional methods available to run code asynchronously:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>after a set time period elapsed</li>
    <li>or at regular intervals of time</li>
    <li><mark><strong>setTimeout()</strong></mark> The <em>setTimeout()</em> function executes a particular block of code once after a specified time has elapsed.</li>
    <li>Syntax: <pre><code style="background-color:lightyellow;">setTimeout(function, duration, param1, param2, ...)</code></pre></li>
    <li>The first parameter is a function to run, or a reference to a function defined elsewhere.</li>
    <li>The second parameter is a number representing the duration in milliseconds to wait before executing the code.</li>
    <li>After the second parameter, you can pass in zero or more values that represent any parameters you want to pass to the function when it is run.</li>
    <li>To clear a timeout, you can use the <mark><code>clearTimeout()</code></mark> method passing in the identifier returned by setTimeout as a parameter.</li>
    <li>A more practical scenario is clearing timeouts when the component is unmounting to free up the resources and also prevent code from incorrectly executing on an unmounted compontnt.</li>
    <li>
    <strong><mark><code>setIterval()</code></mark></strong>: The <em>setInterval()</em> function repeatedly runs the same code over and over again at regular intervals.
    </li>
    <li>Syntax: <pre><code style="background-color:lightyellow;">setInterval(function, duration, param1, param2, ...)</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li>The first parameter is the code to execute.</li>
        <li>The second parameter is the duration in milliseconds</li>
        <li>After the second parameter, you can pass in zero or more values that represent any parameters you want to pass to the function when it is run.</li>
      </ul>    
    </li>
    <li>Intervals keep running a task forever so you should clear the interval when appropriate.</li>
  </ul>  
  </li>
  <li><h3>Noterworthy points</h3>
    <ol>
  <li>Timers and intervals are not part of JavaScript itself. They are implemented by the browser and setTimeout and setInterval are basically names given to that functionality in JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Duration paramter is the minimum delay, not guaranteed delay.</li>
  <li>It is possible to achieve the same effect as setInterval with a recursive setTimeout.</li>
  <li>In recursive <em>setTimeout()</em>, duration is guaranteed between executions. Irrespective of how long the code takes to run, the inverval will remain the same. You can also calculate a different delay before running each iteration.</li>
  <li>With <em>setInterval()</em>, the duration interval includes the time taken to execute the code you want to run. First time the code takes 40ms to run, the interval is 60ms. Second time the code takes 50ms to run, the interval is 50ms. Moreover, setIterval is always a fixed interval duration.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Callbacks</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In JavaScript, <em>functions</em> are first class objects.</li>
    <li>Just like an object, a function can be passed as an <em>argument</em> to a function.</li>
    <li>A function can also be returned as values from other functions.</li>
    <li>Any function that is passed as an argument to another function is called a <mark><em>callback function</em></mark> in JavaScript.</li>
    <li>The function which accepts a function as an argument or returns a function is called a <em>higher order function</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Synchronous Callbacks</strong>: A callback which is executed immediately is called a synchronous callback.</li>
    <li>Example of synchronous callbacks:<pre><code style="background-color:lightgray;">
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
numbers.sort( (a,b) => a - b );
numbers.map(n => n * 2 );
numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 2 );
</code></pre></li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous callbacks</strong>: 
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
        <li>An asynchronous callback is a callback that is often used to continue or resume code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed.</li>
        <li>Callbacks are used to delay the execution of a function until a particular time or event has occured.</li>
        <li>Data fetching takes time and we can only run the function we want to after the data has been fetched and not immediately.</li>
      </ol>
